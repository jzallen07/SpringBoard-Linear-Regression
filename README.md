# SpringBoard-Linear-Regression
SpringBoard Machine Learning mini project Linear Regression

## Background
The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Resources
This data set is available in the sklearn python module which is how we will access it today.

## Conclusion
Using interpretation of scipy.stats model summaries and sklearn we will implement a linear regression model to predict housing prices.
